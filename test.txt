eg -> 
sample.txt has "My Name is Arundhati" in it
SOP(fis.read()) -> return 77, ASCII of 'M'
SOP((char)fis.read()) -> return M, the character
---
int i = fis.read();   ->i stores ASCII value of first char
while(i!=-1)          ->every character has an ASCII value, if it is -1, meaning its blank, no characters end of sample.text 
  {char c = (char)i;  ->typecasts it to char
   SOP(c);            ->prints that char
   i = fis.read();    ->moves to next char
  }
//now i is at blank, i.e. no more characters present -> exit reader, fis
